<h2>Learn To Map Quickstart Tutorial</h4>
<ol>
<li>Setup an account at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="Open StreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a>.  Once you have your account setup and confirmed, return here to continue!</li>
<li><h4>Overview of OpenStreetMap iD Editor</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="Open StreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> website offers an online map editor, know as iD.  This basic editor will be the subject of this tutorial.</p>
<p>Log in to OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>Try out the map controls on the right side of the screen. You may zoom in, zoom out and view your current location. Select between layers, view the map key, share the map and make comments.</p>
<p>Try out the search OpenStreetMap function on the left side of the screen. Search for any location; type in any location to load a map of that area.</p>
<p>Use the zoom in button on the right of the screen to examine the map closely. Depending on where you've selected, you should be able to see the three main elements of OpenStreetMap: points, lines and areas.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>How to Edit in OpenStreetMap</h4>
<p>To create points, lines and areas in OpenstreetMap, click the drop down arrow next to the word Edit. Select the option Edit with iD (in browser editor.)</p>

<p>The iD editor opens by showing you the location you previously selected.</p>

<p>At the top of the iD editor are the main controls. Select an action to perform: map a point, line or an area. The buttons to go back, forward and save are also at the top.</p>

<p>By clicking save after making an edit to OpenStreetMap, your changes go live to the entire world. Save often!</p>

<p>Use the dialogue box to the left of the map to input information about the points, lines, and areas that you map. You do not need to know the name of the place, road or area. Just marking it on the map is very helpful for others who can add in details.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Walkthrough</h4>
<p>To the right of the map, there is a help button and the option to walkthrough the process of editing in OpenStreetMap. You may have completed the walkthrough previously. If not, take the walkthrough to become familiar with the elements of the iD OpenStreetMap editor and how to view buildings, roads and areas on satellite imagery.</p>

</li>

<li><h4>Select an area to start practice mapping</h4>
<p>Find an area in Dade County you are familiar with, perhaps near your home.  Type the location in the search box and hit go to try to find it on the map.  If the area is found, it will appear in the results area.  You may then click on the resuklt to have the map take you to that location.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Map a Point</h4>
To map a point in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:
<p>Select the Point button in the top left of the map. It will turn blue to let you know that it's been selected. Then click a position in the map where there is a building or area that you'd like to define.</p>
<p>A Node icon appears. (Wikipedia defines a node as: “One of the core elements in the OpenStreetMap data model. It consists of a single point in space defined by its latitude, longitude and node id.”)</p>
<p>The Set feature type dialog box also appears to the left of the map with a series of descriptive inputs. If you know the name of the building or area, or additional details, enter them here.</p>
<p>Once you've finished adding details connected to the node, close the dialog box by clicking on the X to the right of Edit Feature at the top.</p>
<p>To edit the node again, click on it again and the dialog box will reopen.</p>
<P>IMPORTANT: Note that when drawing roads (see Map a Line below) there must always be an intersection Node present at every intersection!</p>
<p>To delete a node that is incorrect, or created by mistake, click on node. A trashcan icon appears next to it. Click on the trashcan to remove the node.</p>
<p>If you ever need to step back a few edits, click the back arrow icon at the top of the editor. You can allow step forward a few edits with the forward arrow icon.</p>
<p>Click save at the top of the editor to make sure your edits are logged into the OpenStreetMap database.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Map a Line</h4>
<p>To map a line in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:</p>
<p>Click the Line button at the top of the iD OpenStreetMap editor. It turns blue to indicate it is selected.</p>
<p>Click on a position on the map. A dot appears connected to a line.</p>
<p>Click on another other point on the map; another dot appears and the line will connect those two points.</p>
<p>Draw more points to establish the line or, click the Esc escape button on your keyboard to finish drawing the line.</p>
<p>The line then glows red to let you know that it has been created and a dialog box opens up to the left of the map editor.</p>
<p>Specify whether the line is a road, path, river or other options.</p>
<P>IMPORTANT: Note that when drawing roads there must always be an intersection Node present at every intersection!</p>
<p>You may be specific or general depending on the satellite picture.</p>
<p>To modify a line that has already been created, click on it. The dialog box reopens next to the editor along with the trashcan icon next to the line.</p>
<p>Always remember to hit save at the top of the editor so your edits are logged into the OpenStreetMap database.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Map an Area</h4>
<p>An area can be a park, a building, a lake, a forest or other types of enclosed filled land. To map an area in the OpenStreetMap iD editor:</p>
<p>Click on the area button at the top of the editor. It turns blue to let you know that you've selected it.</p>
<p>Select the edges of the building or land you want to define. Just click on the corners and the editor will fill in the space between.</p>
<p>Once you've fully outlined what you want, double click on the last created point to complete the area. The area will turn red to let you know that it's been created.</p>
<p>A dialog box will appear next to the map editor and allow you to classify the area you've just defined. There are numerous options and you may be as general or specific as possible.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific name of the area, leave this section blank. Just label what you can see from the satellite imagery — such as a "lake" or "building".</p>
<p>Click save at the top of the editor to make sure your edits are logged into the OpenStreetMap database.
Once you hit save your edits are live and part of the OpenStreetMap data and immediately available to anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Take some time to practice what you’ve just learned. Once you feel confident in your ability to map, continue.</p>
